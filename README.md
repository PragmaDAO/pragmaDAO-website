## 📚 What You'll Learn
Our curriculum is designed to be comprehensive, covering the entire lifecycle of smart contract development. Topics include:

💎 Solidity Fundamentals: Master the core concepts, from variables, functions, and control structures to contract inheritance and visibility.

🛡️ Smart Contract Security: Learn to identify and mitigate common vulnerabilities like reentrancy, integer overflows, and improper access control. Build secure and resilient applications.

🧪 Testing & Deployment: Get hands-on experience with industry-standard tools like Foundry and Hardhat to test, debug, and deploy your contracts.

🧩 Advanced Patterns: Dive into more complex topics like upgradeable contracts (proxies), design patterns, and gas optimization techniques.

💰 DeFi & NFT Standards: Understand the building blocks of decentralized finance and the digital art world by exploring token standards like ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155.

## ✨ Our Learning Philosophy
We believe the best way to learn is by doing, one step at a time.

Modular Lessons: Our content is broken down into short, bite-sized lessons. Each one focuses on a specific concept, making complex topics easy to digest.

Stackable Knowledge: Every lesson builds upon the previous one, creating a clear and structured path from beginner to advanced practitioner.

Daily Updates: The Web3 space moves fast. To keep you on the cutting edge, new lessons will be added every day, ensuring our curriculum is always current.
