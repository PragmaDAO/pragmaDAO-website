## Lesson 1: Your First Smart Contract

Welcome to Solidity! In this first lesson, you'll write and compile your very first smart contract. This is the "Hello, World!" of the blockchain world.

### Objectives

- Understand the basic structure of a Solidity file.
- Declare a contract.
- Create a public state variable.
- Compile your contract and see the output.


### Instructions

-   In the editor on the right, define a contract named `HelloWorld`.
    Hint: `contract MyContract { ... }`
-   Inside the contract, create a public state variable of type `string` named `greet`. 
    Hint: `string public myString;`
-   Initialize the `greet` variable with the value `"Hello World!"`.
    Hint: `string public myString = "initial value";`
-   Click the "Compile" button. If there are no errors, click "Run Tests" to check your work!
    Hint: Once the 'Compile' button shows a success message, you're ready to run the tests!
