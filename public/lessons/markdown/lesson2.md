## Lesson 2: Understanding Variables & Types

Smart contracts are all about managing state. In this lesson, you'll learn about the fundamental data types in Solidity.

### Instructions

1.  Define a contract named `VariableTypes`.
    Hint: `contract VariableTypes {\n    // add your code here\n}`
2.  Create a public `uint` variable named `myUint` and set it to `123`.
    Hint: `uint public myUint = 123;`
3.  Create a public `string` variable named `myString` and set it to `"Pragma"`.
    Hint: `string public myString = "Pragma";`
4.  Create a public `bool` variable named `myBool` and set it to `true`.
    Hint: `bool public myBool = true;`
