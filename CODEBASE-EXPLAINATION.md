##  Codebase explanations
Here's an organizational chart of the codebase with explanations for each folder:
    1 /pragmaDAO-website/
    2 ├── .git/                 # Git version control system files (hidden).
    3 ├── .vscode/              # Visual Studio Code specific settings and configurations.
    4 ├── build/                # Contains the optimized production build of your React application.
    5 ├── node_modules/         # Stores all the third-party libraries and dependencies installed via npm.
    6 ├── public/               # Static assets served directly by the web server (e.g. index.html, images, manifest, markdown files, solidity files).
    7 │   ├── favicon.ico       # Website favicon.
    8 │   ├── index.html        # The main HTML file for your React application.
    9 │   ├── logo192.png       # Application logo (192x192).
   10 │   ├── logo512.png       # Application logo (512x512).
   11 │   ├── manifest.json     # Web app manifest file for progressive web app features.
   12 │   └── lessons/          # Contains lesson-related static assets.
   13 │       ├── markdown/     #  Markdown files for the lessons.
   14 │       └── solidity/     # Solidity code files for the lessons.
   15 └── src/                  # Source code for your React application.
   16     ├── App.tsx           # Main application component.
   17     ├── index.css         # Global CSS styles.
   18     ├── index.tsx         # Entry point for the React application (renders App.tsx).
   19     ├── types.ts          # TypeScript type definitions used across the application.
   20     ├── components/       # Reusable React components (e.g., Header, Footer, custom UI elements).
   21     ├── lessons/          # React components specifically for each lesson.
   22     │   └── __tests__/    # Test files for the lesson components.
   23     ├── pages/            # Top-level React components representing different pages of the website.
   24     └── types/            # (Potentially redundant with top-level types.ts, or for more specific types)

  Explanation of Folders:
   * .git/: This hidden directory is created and managed by Git. It stores all the information necessary for your project's version control, including commit history, branches, and remote repository details.
   * .vscode/: This folder holds configuration files specific to Visual Studio Code. These settings can include workspace settings, debugger configurations, and recommended extensions for the project.
   * build/: When you run npm run build, this directory is created. It contains the minified, optimized, and compiled version of your React application, ready for deployment to a production server.
   * node_modules/: This directory is automatically generated by npm (or yarn) and contains all the external JavaScript libraries and packages that your project depends on. It's typically very large and should not be committed to version control.
   * public/: This folder holds static assets that are directly served by the web server without being processed by the React build pipeline. This includes your index.html file, images, manifest files, and now your markdown and Solidity lesson files.
   * public/lessons/markdown/: Contains the .md files that are rendered as lesson content.
   * public/lessons/solidity/: Contains the .sol files that are loaded into the Solidity editor for each lesson.
   * src/: This is where the main source code for your React application resides.
   * src/components/: This folder is for smaller, reusable UI components that can be used across different parts of your application (e.g., buttons, navigation bars, cards).
   * src/lessons/: This folder contains the React components that define the structure and logic for each individual lesson.
   * src/lessons/__tests__/: This is where unit tests for the lesson components are located.
   * src/pages/: This folder typically contains larger components that represent entire pages or views of your application (e.g., HomePage, LessonsPage).
   * src/types/: This folder (or types.ts at the root of src) is used to define TypeScript interfaces and types that describe the shape of your data and props, improving code clarity and maintainability.
