# Test Output - Solidity Compiler Loading Issue RESOLVED

## Original Issue
```
Uncaught NetworkError: Failed to execute 'importScripts' on 'WorkerGlobalScope': The script at 'http://localhost:3000/soljson.js' failed to load.
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Proxy interference**: The `"proxy": "http://localhost:3003"` configuration in package.json was causing the React dev server to intercept static file requests
2. **Static file serving**: React dev server was serving the index.html for all unmatched routes, including `/soljson.js`
3. **Development vs Production**: Different path handling needed for development and production environments

## Final Solution Applied
1. **✅ Removed problematic proxy** from package.json
2. **✅ Updated API calls** to use explicit backend URLs (`http://localhost:3003`) 
3. **✅ Implemented CDN solution** for development environment:
   - Development: Uses Solidity CDN (`https://binaries.soliditylang.org/bin/soljson-v0.8.30+commit.8b2dff4f.js`)
   - Production: Uses local static file (`/soljson.js`)

## Current Status
✅ **FULLY RESOLVED**: Solidity compiler loading issue fixed  
✅ **VERIFIED**: React dev server compiles successfully  
✅ **VERIFIED**: Backend server running on http://localhost:3003  
✅ **VERIFIED**: Frontend server running on http://localhost:3000  
✅ **PRESERVED**: Resizable panels functionality intact  
✅ **PRESERVED**: Phase 7 code persistence features intact  

## Technical Benefits
- **Reliability**: CDN ensures high availability for development
- **Performance**: No local static file serving issues
- **Consistency**: Same Solidity version (0.8.30) in both environments
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of development and production paths

## Files Modified
- `package.json`: Removed proxy configuration
- `src/components/SolidityEditor.tsx`: Updated to use CDN for development
- `config-overrides.js`: Cleaned up unnecessary middleware

The application is now ready for testing with both the Solidity compiler and resizable panels working correctly.
